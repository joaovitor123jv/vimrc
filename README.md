# Vimrc

This repository contains the configuration files for VIM and NVIM that I use
for general Programming.

## Directory structure

The `vim-settings` directory contains the vimrc and gvimrc for usage with the
default VIM (using vimscript). Be sure to read vim-settings/README.md to get
a grasp on the features provided.

The `nvim-settings` directory contains the equivalent to `$HOME/.config/nvim`
configurations. It is written in Lua, and uses several plugins (written for
nvim) with different keymaps in some cases.

Be sure to read the subdirectories for specific info about the settings.

## Disclaimer

BTW, this is a personal project that I made public in order to help anyone that
is trying to configure your own VIM or NVIM with your own choices of plugins,
but I provide no guarantee that it will work. Use this at your own risk.

I recommend learning VIM or NVIM before understanding the contents of the
settings here, many things are NOT documented.
